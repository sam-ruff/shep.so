# Completion audit

The user requested a complete, polished Rust + iced mail/calendar client. Passing the current suite is evidence for specific behavior, not evidence that the whole goal is complete. This audit records outstanding work; it does not replace or narrow the original specification.

## Remaining implementation audit

1. Cached queries, body loads and ordered saves have independent workers, verified with provider slots/queue occupied. Startup defers the Google keychain check. Preferences now use versioned acknowledgements; backup completion changes only metadata. Detail revisions reject stale bodies/errors after flag/move changes. Still review closing during a debounced/pending preference save and retrying a full persistence queue.
2. Complete account/calendar lifecycle and make connection errors recoverable without leaving stale sources or credentials. CalDAV discovery/connection testing and Google calendar access roles are now implemented; reviewed local removal and retryable credential cleanup now survive restart. Remaining lifecycle work includes global Google sign-out, retaining an archive while disconnected, source-specific credential editing and coordination across independent app processes.
3. Outgoing attachments, CC/BCC and Reply all are implemented with versioned draft persistence, file caching and native picker tests. SMTP loopback contracts verify recipient envelopes, hidden Bcc headers, binary MIME, rejection and lost acknowledgment diagnostics. Still implement server Sent handling, durable recovery for ambiguous delivery. Related cached messages now have separate reader cards, linked by explicit message references within each account.
4. Exercise POP3 through deterministic protocol contracts; extend SMTP coverage to authentication and server Sent handling. Google refresh now coalesces across callers, preserves/replaces refresh tokens according to the response, retries a failed keychain save before using the new grant, and serializes sign-in against refresh. Pending login grants can finish without another browser/code exchange. Revoked grants require reconnect; client-secret errors can be corrected. Tests cover these paths plus client binding, response bounds including chunked bodies, malformed/redirected responses, secret-safe diagnostics and fragmented/invalid loopback callbacks. Still finish partial permission grants and connection lifecycle; genuine Google authorization remains unverified. Drive has bounded pagination/JSON, ownership checks, pre-generated IDs, resumable chunks, checkpoints, checksums and restart recovery. Restore validates complete archives, reconstructs MIME display/search data off-thread, and commits new mail/configuration atomically before missing-password recovery. Existing mail/settings/passwords/drafts are preserved, and recovered mail absent from the server survives sync. Large imports still hold the cache connection during the transaction; finish independent cached reads during restore/export. Add lifecycle controls for abandoned uploads when removing a destination/account. Loopback contracts are not live-service evidence.
5. Review the current 25 MiB message and 256 MiB snapshot ceilings against real mailbox sizes. Large-mail/backup paths must remain bounded in memory while avoiding silent omissions.
6. Review scaled fonts, compact windows, empty/error states and keyboard/mouse parity. Finish with the full functional suite, final performance gates, release/install checks, and a push to `sam-ruff/shep.so`.

Live Google/CalDAV and Windows/macOS execution are not established by Linux fixture tests. Do not describe those checks as completed. Useful independent development remains, so the goal is not blocked on that verification yet.

## Calendar correctness evidence

`src/providers/calendar/*` contains loopback HTTP contract tests for Google pagination/conditional PATCH/DELETE, stable POST retry recovery, malformed committed responses, redirect rejection, and CalDAV REPORT/GET/PUT/DELETE with ETags. CalDAV edits retain alarms, attendees, timezones and extension properties. Conflict tests ensure another client's changes are not overwritten.

`tests/calendar.rs` covers all-day/default/DURATION semantics (including DST), escaped text, source-scoped IDs, atomic mixed-source rejection, and migration from the original cache keys. Engine tests cover source-scoped mutation and acknowledgment after a remote commit even when local caching fails. The native MCP suite edits and deletes one of two events with the same remote UID in different calendars.

## Composer correctness evidence

`tests/composing.rs`, `providers/smtp_tests.rs` and UI ordering tests cover cached outgoing files, recipient validation/privacy, Reply-To/thread headers, migration and stale-save/sent-draft behavior. The native MCP suite uses the actual file chooser, saves and reopens attachments after source deletion, removes wrapped files, retains a draft after preview send refusal, and checks Reply all with both mouse and keyboard. Standard light/dark and 900×640 composer captures accompany these flows. The SMTP fixture exercises production delivery with a local transport; it does not establish live mail delivery. No new timing claims accompany this work.

## Conversation reader evidence

The reader groups downloaded messages across folders within one account using Message-ID, References and In-Reply-To. Subject matches alone do not merge mail. Duplicate mailbox copies display once, preserving the selected physical message for actions. The inbox continues to list individual messages. A General preference restores individual-message reading; quote display remains independently configurable.

Conversation metadata uses 20-message pages. Only the focused body and existing bounded neighbor cache load message contents; SQL ranking excludes raw MIME and body text. Older caches index in resumable 32-message transactions after the workspace becomes visible. New sync and restore writes update the index atomically. Store tests cover late parents, bridging references, account isolation, duplicate copies, deletion, flags, paging and reopening an unfinished backfill. UI tests reject stale results and keep replies targeted to the expanded message. The saturated-provider test also covers conversation reads.

Native MCP flows cover older Sent replies and attachments, mouse flagging, moving the expanded message, collapse/expand, the preference toggle, full-window reading, dark/compact layouts and long-thread paging during sync. Harness waits tolerate temporarily missing list entries while asynchronous pages refresh. These are functional checks; performance measurements remain deferred.

## Calendar connection and access evidence

`providers/calendar/discovery.rs` performs authenticated, bounded PROPFIND discovery through same-origin redirects, well-known/principal/home paths and direct collections. It handles unsupported optional properties, filters VEVENT collections, preserves collection URLs, and records separate create/update/delete privileges when supplied. Redirect loops, cross-origin targets, malformed/incomplete responses, authentication failures and response/request limits have loopback protocol tests. These are server-URL discovery tests; DNS SRV discovery and genuine homeserver verification are not established.

The native connection form finds calendars before saving, offers multiple selections and retains errors for retry. Discovery results carry form generations; credential edits/new dialogs invalidate old results. Calendar connection acknowledgments cannot close another editor. Reconnect deduplicates by URL/username and derives OS credential identifiers internally. Multi-source metadata saves use one atomic store write. Google list parsing is bounded and paginated, records access roles, and disables stale grants absent from a complete listing while keeping cached events. Read-only event views, writable defaults and provider/engine mutation guards enforce the advertised permissions. Legacy source records preserve their existing behavior until access is refreshed.

The saved MCP scenarios exercise selection/empty selection, connection failure and retry, repeated connection without duplicates, read-only viewing, and light/dark/900×640 layouts. Production never includes the fixture calendars or performs real service access in preview. Broader lifecycle work and live-service/non-Linux verification remain outstanding; no new timing claims accompany this feature.

## Connection removal evidence

Accounts and individual calendars have reviewed removal controls with exact local message/draft/event counts. A transactional fingerprint check rejects newly arrived mail, edited drafts or changed attachments even when counts are unchanged. Unfinished cross-account transfer journals need explicit cancellation. Account removal clears its cached MIME/search/conversation metadata, folders, drafts and attachment blobs; calendar removal is scoped by source even for shared remote event IDs. Server originals and existing backup copies are retained.

Local removal and credential cleanup jobs commit atomically. The OS deletion is retryable after failure/restart, treats missing secrets as success, and checks other current owners before removing a shared key. A lifecycle lock coordinates config/password writes, cleanup and restore; deterministic fake-keychain tests hold cleanup while reconnect waits. Tombstones stop delayed cache/draft writes. Calendar removal epochs outlive reconnection to reject old setup commands. Separate connection/calendar revisions stop delayed UI snapshots from restoring removed rows or events. Explicit backup restore can reconnect removed owners and cancel obsolete cleanup jobs.

Google calendar removal suppresses automatic re-import without deleting the shared Google credential. An explicit restore action reconnects calendars still accessible from the Google list. Native fixture flows cover reviewed removal/cancellation, draft counts, blocked confirmation for unfinished moves, remaining inbox navigation, calendar restoration and light/dark/compact layouts. These tests do not remove personal accounts or mutate live mail/calendars. Broader lifecycle and final performance verification remain outstanding.

This lifecycle increment passes formatting, Clippy with warnings denied, 138 Rust tests (two opt-in live tests ignored), 12 Python tests and all 34 native functional scenarios. Header light/dark/compact captures were reviewed again. Performance measurements remain deferred; this is progress toward the full goal, not a completion claim.
